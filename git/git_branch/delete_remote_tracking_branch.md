# delete remote-tracking-branch

```
D:\Github_Repositories\zengjiapei3000>git branch -rl
  origin/HEAD -> origin/master
  origin/main
  origin/master
```

Then I'll delete `origin/main`, because it isn't exist.

` git branch -rd origin/main`

Then output like this:
`Deleted remote-tracking branch origin/main (was 6c8cd0c).`

Finish.
